\chapter{PPU}

Screen resolution is $256 \times 240$ pixels.
Tiles are $8 \times 8$, $8 \times 16$, or $16 \times 8$ pixels.
There are $64$ possible colours.

However, some of these colours are duplicates (black).

The PPU runs at $3 \times$ the frequency of the CPU.

Each PPU cycle (during the drawing phase) the PPU outputs one pixel to the
screen.

It has per pixel scrolling.

It can support up to $64$ sprites.

A scanline is one row of the screen, it renders line by line ($y$ is fixed, $x$
ranges over $0-256$).

On a single scanline, it only supports $8$ sprites.

If there are more than $8$ sprites, it will set a sprite overflow bit.

It can detect hits to sprite 0.

It is controlled by memory mapped registers to the CPU.

It has \texttt{2 KiB} of RAM.

It has \texttt{256 B} of RAM for sprites.

It has \texttt{64 B} of RAM for sprites on the current scanline.

Each sprite takes \texttt{4 B}.

Background is drawn from the current nametable.

\subsection{Screen}

The current scanline is the $y$ coordinate.

A grid of the pixels is shown below:

\begin{tikzpicture}
  \draw (0, 0) -- (80mm, 0);
  \node [above] at (40mm, 0) {$x$};
  \node [above] at (0, 0) {\texttt{0}};
  \node [above] at (80mm, 0) {\texttt{255}};

  \draw (0, 0) -- (0, -70mm);
  \node [left] at (0, -35mm) {$y$};
  \node [left] at (0, 0) {\texttt{0}};
  \node [left] at (0, -70mm) {\texttt{239}};
\end{tikzpicture}

\begin{tikzpicture}
  \matrix [matrix of nodes, nodes in empty cells,
           row sep=1mm, column sep=1mm,
           nodes=draw,
           minimum width=8mm, minimum height=8mm] {
      & & & & & & & \\
      & & & & & & & \\
      & & & & & & & \\

  };
\end{tikzpicture}

v: \hexadecimal{2000} = \binary{0010 0000 0000 0000}

v: \hexadecimal{2000} = \binary{0010 NN11 11YY YXXX}
