  \chapter{CPU}

  The NES CPU is a modified 6502. It is an 8-bit CPU. It has an accumlator
  register (A), two index registers (X and Y). It has a register for the
  processor status flag bits (P). It has an 8-bit stack pointer (S) which is
  256 bytes large and always starts with address $(\texttt{10})_{16}$. The
  program counter (PC) is 16-bit.
